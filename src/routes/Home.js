      The body of knowledge and practice known as mathematics is derived from the
      contributions of thinkers throughout the ages and across the globe. It gives
      us a way to understand patterns, to quantify relationships, and to predict
      the future. Math helps us understand the world â€” and we use the world to
      understand math.

      The world is interconnected. Everyday math shows these connections
      and possibilities. The earlier young learners can put these skills

      Algebra can explain how quickly water becomes contaminated and how many
      people in a third-world country drinking that water might become sickened
      on a yearly basis. A study of geometry can explain the science behind
      architecture throughout the world. Statistics and probability can estimate
      death tolls from earthquakes, conflicts and other calamities around the world.
      It can also predict profits, how ideas spread, and how previously endangered
      animals might repopulate.
